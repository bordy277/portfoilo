		As a Minnesota native, Brody Steineck hails from a little town just east of the Twin Cities. Growing up, Brody found himself surrounded by people who radiated artistic talent. Over the years he started to gain interest in various forms of art himself. Drawing was the first medium that he began using to express him self until he was introduced to the dirty, grimy, beautiful world of ceramics.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Ceramics eventually became a hobby, and it was time for Brody to move on and plan for the future. It was at this time that he enrolled at the University of Minnesota in order to pursue his undergraduate degree in Graphic Design. Since then, Brody has found the Twin Cities to be a great place to live and looks forward to all of the opportunities that lie ahead.

		<br/>
		Outside of work, Brody enjoys music that isnâ€™t bad, interesting people who have a good story or two, viewing every film he can get his hands on, and beer.
