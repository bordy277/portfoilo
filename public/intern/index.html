				<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					<b>Hello, my name is Brody,</b>
				</br>
				</br>	
					In the last year and a half, my interests have turned a corner towards the world of development & design. This summer I had the opportunity to expand my design and development knowledge with a company known as – <b>Conservis</b>.
				</br>
				</br>
					I was given this opportunity through a family connection, and at first it seemed like an unorthodox fit for what I was looking for. But, to my surprise the whole experience turned out to be perfect. It allowed me to gain knowledge of the professional world, user interface design, and left room for me to <br>experiment and engage all on my own. 
				</br>
				</br>
					The following is a documentation of my experience and the product of my work.
				</p>

				<h2><div class="arrow"></div>The Company</h2>

				<div class="combine">
					<div class="center">
						<img src="images/combine.jpg" />
					</div>	
				</div>	

				<p>
					In short, <b>Conservis Corporation</b> is an agriculture management company. The goal of Conservis products is to streamline the farming process from planting season to harvest in every way. 
				</br>
				</br>
					They can manage production from anywhere with purchases, inventory and activities accessible at a glance. Easily analyze the impact of decisions and smoothly share information with outside partners and accounting systems.
				</br>
				</br>
					And when you are ready to harvest, Conservis will keep tabs on harvest activities to track yields, inventories and deliveries directly from the field. Update customer information, identify problems, and measure your performance wherever you’re working. (conserviscorp.com)
				</br>
				</br>
					All of this and more can be found at their current company website <a href="http://conserviscorp.com/" target="_blank"> www.conserviscorp.com </a>

				</p>

				<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Who, What, Where, Why?</h2>
				<p>
					So, if conservis is an agriculture company, then you may be wondering why they would need/want a Graphic Design intern? Well, it's because Conservis had recently decided to implement a complete rebrand of the company. 
				</br>
				</br>
					Not only was the company working towards a new brand, but they also were looking to create new media applications that they could sell as products to their customers (The products will be expanded on later). Of course, I was not going to rebrand the entire company by myself in just three short months. The process had actually begun before I had arrived. 

					The Company had already acquired two contracting designers to complete the project:
				</br>
				</br>

					<h1><b>Travis Olsen</b></h1>
					<p>
						Travis was the creative director for the project. Travis used to work at <i>Mono</i> in Minneaplis before deciding<br> to create his own company. I learned at lot of things about the design process and how to approach <br>client situations.
					</p>

					<h1><b>Ben Hribar</b></h1>
					<p>
						Ben was primarily the interace designer for the new products. Ben taught me many things about interface <br>design and style. He showed me the importance of the grid system and that less is more if done properly.
					</p>
				</br>
					<p>
						These wonderful designers allowed me to assist them in the rebranding process for Conservis. Together, we resolved various problems and challenges that accompany design. 
					</p>
					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>The New Look</h2>
					<p><b> Some new design assets</b> </p>
					<div id="logo">
						<img src="images/logo.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p>
						When I arrived at my new position, Travis and Ben had already created a whole set of design elements for the company including logo, iconography, colors, etc.
					</p>
					<p><b> Iconography </b></p>
					<div id="icons">
						<img src="images/icons.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p> 
						These are just a few examples of the new look. One of my duties while working for Conservis was to create an online <b>Styleguide</b> for the company's new look. The full style guide can be found here at this link:<br> <a href="styleguide/index.html" target="_blank"> Conservis Styleguide </a>
					</p>

					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>The Products</h2>
					<p>
						Conservis' services revolve around three main products – <b>Office, Tasks, and Clipboard.</b> 
					</p>

					<div id="products">
						<div id="center">
							<img src="images/products.jpg" />
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Office</h2>

					<p>
						Rebranding <b>Office</b> was my responsibility while at Conservis. My job was to take the design assets that the lead designers had given me, and use them to create a new and inviting look for the back office product.
					</br>
					</br>
						I also took it upon my self to code the new look into a login & home screen for the developers to take from.	
					</p>
					<div id="office">
						<img src="images/office.jpg" />
					</div>

					<p>
						The goal was to create a website that is not only attractive, but also adequatley consolidates the copious amount of information that can be accessed on the site.
					</br>
					</br>
						This was done by created a double navigation bar that is not confusing or excessive. Then all of the tabs would have a drop down menu that would allow
						the user to choose a specific location from.
					</br>
					</br>
						<b>Try it out!</b> The coded version can be found at this link: <a href="website/index.html" target="_blank">Conservis Office</a> (Note: Only the Harvest link at the top will have active tabs when clicked on.)
					</p>

					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Office Continued...</h2>

					<p>
						Along with creating a new look for Office, I helped with the restructuring of the complicated back office information pages. This included numerous rounds of revision. Each page needed to be restructed to fit the needs of the user trying the add, subtract, or find information about their farm.
					</p>
					<div id="pages">
						<img src="images/pages.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p>
						Just to show a few.
					</p>
					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Tasks</h2>
					<p>
						<b>Tasks</b> is an applciation used for the purpose of assigning tasks to fields and field hands. The app allows an owner or foreman to organize the daily, weekly, or monthly responsibilities ahead of time in an organizational manner. Anything can be changed or edited in real-time if need be.
					</p>
					<div id="tasks">
						<img src="images/tasks.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p>
						My involvement with the Tasks application was limited, but did exist. From time to time I created icons and helped make decisions for the future of Tasks. I spent many hours communicating with the developers in Belarus, so that our design was clear to them.
					</br>
					</br>
						I helped develop the first draft of the Tasks applciation, which can be seen here: <a href="ag21/index.html" target="_blank">Tasks Version One</a>. It can only be viewed correctly if the window in a certain width. It was my first real crack at coding an application online and lacks proper development properties. Nevertheless, I probably learned the most while attempting to create it. I have come a long way since.
					</p>

					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Clipboard</h2>
					<p>
						Conservis also created and applciation called <b>Clipboard</b>. Clipboard is primarily a mapping tool used to view a farm property via satelite. An owner can check on there fields and task progress just by clicking on a field. They can also view past and future information about the status of the farm as a whole and by specific field.
					</p>
					<div id="clipboard">
						<img src="images/clipboard.jpg" />
					</div>
					<p>
						My involvement in Clipboard was similar to that of Tasks. I sat in on design meetings and helped make user interface decisions along with product functionality.
					</p>

					<h2><div class="arrow"></div>Conclusion</h2>

					<p>
						Although unexpected, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Conservis Corp. The knowledge and experience I gained was priceless. The nature of my position allowed me to explore new directions with ease while keeping me on track with the client. It also showed me that there are many parts to a branding process and that knowing the client is more important than anything else. I now feel more confident in all categories of design as we know it...although I am no expert and plan to keep on learning as much as possible.
					</br>
					</br>	
						I plan to pursue further information about the develpment world and will always remember Conservis <br>as the place where it all began.
